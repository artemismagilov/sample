            <h2>Hello, my name is Artem. A little bit about yourself</h2>
            <p>
                This is my first portfolio. In this project, I would like to talk about my acquired skills, goals and just personal interests that cover not only the front-end html, css, javascript but also backend languages ​​such as python. 
            </p>
            <p> In this specialization I learned to use templates, bootstrap framework and pure media queries for responsive design. 
                In addition, I managed to learn a lot of subtleties with javascript to add interactivity with the client. 
            </p>
            <p>I had great pleasure trying new tags, fonts, styles and so on to improve the quality of my product as a website. very glad to our teacher. 
                thank Coleen. She supports us very much, explains in an accessible way, it is interesting to listen to her, I love her. for a high-quality frontend, there is not enough experience yet. however, 
            </p>    
            <p>I still love Python very much, because with it I have already become acquainted not only with built-in types, syntax, OOP, but also with the standard library, asinae for parallel programming, even for server deployment. with the help of django, I immersed myself even more in the backend world and can already make a small application. 
                In general, I am very interested in the field of technology, the Internet and with great pleasure I can make idea for the whole world, thank you for your attention
